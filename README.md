A bank wants to roll out Christmas offers to their customers. But Bank does not want to roll out same offer to all customers  instead they want to roll out personalized offer to particular set of customers. If they manually start understanding the category of customer then this will be not efficient and also they will not be able to uncover the hidden pattern in the data ( pattern which group certain kind of customer in one category). Bank approached ABC analytics company to solve their problem. Bank also shared information with ABC analytics that they don't want more than 5 group as this will be inefficient for their campaign.
